### Random list of hobbyist side projects I'm always happy to talk about
|Name|Description|
|--|--|
|[OpenGridJs](https://github.com/amurgola/OpenGridJs)| An open-source lightweight JavaScript grid framework that allows you to create fast and easy-to-use data grids in your web application. It supports virtual scrolling, custom column headers, and context menus. I created this due to not finding options that were either free and awful, or freemium with all the great features locked behind extreme licensing fees. Also being native javascript doesn't hurt, many of the free grid options are overbloated requiring jquery.
|[Textbookly](https://www.textbookly.com)|Created back in 2009 when I was a freshman in college, textbookly is a textbook price comparison engine that still sees a massive amount of users every year.|
|[Valdev Image AI](http://valdev.com)|A free web UI for stable diffusion that uses a blend of specialized models, prompting, settings and workflows I created to give a range of outputs. It takes in an image you provide with a prompt, and it transforms it to the likeness of what you prompted.|
|LiteReactorJS|An extremely lightweight JS framework that allows for native html to be reactive to javascript variable updates, allowing for automatic updates by intercepting changes via proxy changes. The output is an extremely simple, low effort, solution to automatically updating UI content.|
|PyWinJammer|Python application for sending key commands to a specified window on a frequency. I needed to create this due to an odd bug in Automatic1111 which sometimes would lockup and require a ctrl+z send to it's cmd.exe to keep it moving. I'm aware this is a bit of an X/Y problem, it was faster than a pull request. |
|Neurosity/Pavlok|Created an application that was driven by Neurosity Crown EEG device to detect when I was out of focus, then hooked that up to a pavlok to shock me. Outcome... I still have ADHD and my arm hurts. I did rewrite the entire Neurosity SDK into C# in this process though.|
|YouTube TLDW|Created an application that can grab a YouTube video, rip its audio track, use an AI workflow to pull out the text, then use some OpenAI Api calls to get a bullet point summary of the video. I plan to publish this... at some point.|
|Puppodoro|I use the pomodoro technique to excess, and it works incredibly well for me. However, when my significant other moved in with me I hit an issue... She had an elderly dog that needs to go out every few hours. I either needed to open two tabs with two timers, or I could do the reasonable thing and build an entire system to manage tasks and allow for adding multiple pomodoro timers. So I did that. Thus, puppodoro!|
|Chromodoro|Similar to the above, except a bit more straight forward. It's a pomodoro timer that utilized the Razer keyboard sdk to display the current timer status through the keyboards colors.|
|MineCrafty/Blockpunchers|I ran a semi popular Minecraft server for a few years and made a ton of mods for minecraft because of that.|
|What else?|Tons more, literally tons. I have forgotten far more projects I have worked on than I could ever remember.|
